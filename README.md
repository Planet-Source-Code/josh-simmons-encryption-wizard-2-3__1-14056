## Encryption Wizard 2\.3


</div>

### Description

Changed the interface a bit, made the labels for the menus into textboxes so they can go *over* the rich text box, thus letting me make it bigger. Added the ability to password protect the program, (the password is encrypted then flipped backwards), and there is now a "QuickCrypt" function that lets you select a file, encrypt it, then save it, without using the open then save and so on options from the menus. Still trying to figure out compression! If you have any idea on how I could get a *nice* way of compression for ALL 255 characters, aside from using the zlib dll, tell me! If you have not seen the other version of this program, 2.2, this program encrypts all 255 characters in a decently strong way. Oh, also added the small part to see that time it took to encrypt the file, it slows down the process though!
